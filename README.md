## Introduction

Entwickeln is a JavaScript library for Conway's Game of Life. The rules are
implemented as described in the
[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
of the game:

> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies,
as if caused by underpopulation.

> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
